## :clipboard: About the project

As my first clone I decided to recreate the interface of a software that is indispensable today: Microsoft Excel. It is a simple clone where it has small interactions for the user in addition to being able to play a little with filling out spreadsheets.

## :computer: Used language

The cool thing is that this project only used CSS putting GRID into practice
